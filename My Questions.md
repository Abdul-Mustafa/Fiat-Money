## Question 5: Do local banks have permission to generate money if someone wants a loan, and how is money created out of nowhere?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Yes, local banks can create new money through the **fractional reserve banking system** when someone takes out a loan. The process works as follows:
1. A bank receives a deposit (e.g., $1,000) and is required to keep only a fraction (e.g., 10%) as reserves.
2. The rest (e.g., $900) is lent to a borrower.
3. This loan creates new money in the form of digital credit, which circulates in the economy.
This new money is "created" from nowhere in the sense that it's not backed by physical cash, but it is a legitimate form of currency in the banking system. The process is regulated to prevent excessive money creation.

## Question 6: Technically, state banks can produce unlimited money, but they do not because it has consequences. Can you explain these consequences in layman's terms?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
